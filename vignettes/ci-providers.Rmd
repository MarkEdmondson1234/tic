## GitHub Actions

{tic} supports running builds on GitHub Actions on all major platforms (Linux, macOS, Windows).
The upstream support for the R language was developed by Jim Hester in [r-lib/actions](https://github.com/r-lib/actions).
This repo also stores some usage [examples](https://github.com/r-lib/actions/tree/master/examples) which differ to the {tic} approach in the following points:

- {tic} makes use of `ccache` for compiler caching enabling faster source installation of packages. 
  The `ccache` directory is cached and build once a week.
- {tic} installs packages from source on Linux by default and does not use package binaries.
- {tic} caches the complete R library and not only the direct packages dependencies (`actions` does this via `remotes::dev_package_deps(dependencies = TRUE)`). 
  The cache is built once per day.

Making use of binaries can speed up build times substantially.
This can be especially attractive for packages with many dependencies or dependencies which take a long time to install.
However, binaries do oft run into problems when the package needs linking against system libraries.
The most prominent example for this is {rJava}.
If the binary was built with the same version as the user is running on the system, everything will work.
However, often enough a different version of the system library is installed and the R packages needs to be installed from source to successfully link against it.

For the case of {rJava}, one needs to 

- add a call to `R CMD javareconf` for **macOS** runners
- add a call to `sudo R CMD javareconf` for **Linux** runners

### macOS toolchain

macOS is a bit tricky when it comes to source installation of packages.
By default `clang` is used instead of `gcc` (Linux) because the former is the default for macOS.
While a custom installation of `clang7` is recommended in [this post](https://thecoatlessprofessor.com/programming/cpp/r-compiler-tools-for-rcpp-on-macos/) by James Balamuta, installing `clang7` is not just more than one line of code, it would also cost some time in every build.
Instead, we currently use the system installation of `clang` and cross fingers...

### Known issues

- [macOS] Installation of {rJava} fails because the default JDK is zulu-13 and not openjdk@11.
  Reconfiguring via `sudo R CMD javareconf` does not help.

- [Windows] Installing {tinytex} for LaTeX availability does not complete

- [All] Deployment from builds
