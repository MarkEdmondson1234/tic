## GitHub Actions

{tic} supports running builds on GitHub Actions on all major platforms (Linux, macOS, Windows).
The upstream support for the R language was developed by Jim Hester in [r-lib/actions](https://github.com/r-lib/actions).
This repo also stores some usage [examples](https://github.com/r-lib/actions/tree/master/examples) which differ to the {tic} approach in the following points:

- {tic} makes use of `ccache` for compiler caching enabling faster source installation of packages. 
  The `ccache` directory is cached and build once a week.
- {tic} installs packages from source on Linux by default and does not use package binaries.
- {tic} caches the complete R library and not only the direct packages dependencies (`actions` does this via `remotes::dev_package_deps(dependencies = TRUE)`). 
  The cache is built once per day.

Making use of binaries can speed up build times substantially.
This can be especially attractive for packages with many dependencies or dependencies which take a long time to install.
However, binaries do oft run into problems when the package needs linking against system libraries.
The most prominent example for this is {rJava}.
If the binary was built with the same version as the user is running on the system, everything will work.
However, often enough a different version of the system library is installed and the R packages needs to be installed from source to successfully link against it.

For the case of {rJava}, one needs to 

- add a call to `R CMD javareconf` for **macOS** runners
- add a call to `sudo R CMD javareconf` for **Linux** runners

### macOS toolchain

macOS is a bit tricky when it comes to source installation of packages.
By default `clang` is used instead of `gcc` (Linux) because the former is the default for macOS.
However, the default `clang` of macOS does not come with openMP support.
Therefore, the R macOS core devs and CRAN currently use a [custom openMP-enabled](https://cran.r-project.org/bin/macosx/tools/) (old) version of `clang` to build the CRAN package binaries.
In {tic} we reflect this by installing `clang7` and `clang8` for the respective R version during build initialization in the "ccache" stages.

### codecov / covr

Unlike Travis CI, Appveyor CI and Circle CI, uploads of code coverage to [codecov.io](https://codecov.io) on GitHub Actions need a "Repository upload token" to upload the coverage results.
{tic} already sets the stage by setting an env var `CODECOV_TOKEN` in the builds from a potential "secret" stored in the repo.
This env var will be picked up behind the scenes by {covr} when running `covr::codecov()`.
The mentioned "secret" however has to be set by the user.
Currently there is no other way than doing this via the web interface.

Go to `<https://codecov.io/gh/<owner>/<repo>/settings>` and store the "Repository upload token" as a "secret" in the repository.
Unfortunately this needs to be done on a per-repo basis.

### rJava

If Java support is required, add the following for macOS runners:

```yaml
      - name: "[macOS] rJava"
        if: runner.os == 'macOS'
        run: |
          R CMD javareconf
          Rscript -e "install.packages('rJava', type = 'source')"
```

For Linux, add `sudo R CMD javareconf` to stage "[Linux] Prepare".
We currently do not support Java on Windows.

### Spatial libraries (gdal, proj, geos)

For spatial packages on macOS, we currently recommend building against the latest GDAL and PROJ v5:

```yaml
brew install gdal
brew unlink proj
brew install osgeo-proj@5
brew link --force osgeo-proj@5
```

On Linux, add `libgdal-dev libproj-dev libgeos-dev` to the `apt install` call in the "[Linux] Prepare" stage.

### Known issues

- [macOS] Installation of {rJava} fails because the default JDK is zulu-13 and not openjdk@11.
  Reconfiguring via `sudo R CMD javareconf` does not help.

- [Windows] Installing {tinytex} for LaTeX availability does not complete

- [All] Deployment from builds
