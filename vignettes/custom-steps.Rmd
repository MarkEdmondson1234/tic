A step is an environment-like (or list-like) object with named members `check`, `prepare`, and `run`.
These members should be functions that are callable without arguments.
The tic package uses [R6](https://github.com/wch/R6) to define a base class `TicStep`.
All steps defined by tic, including the example `HelloWorld` step, use `TicStep` as a base class.
See [`steps-base.R`](https://github.com/ropenscilabs/tic/blob/master/R/steps-base.R) for the implementation.
The `step_...` functions in tic are simply the `new()` methods of the corresponding R6 class objects.
I recommend following the same pattern for your custom steps.

In the following, the three methods which your derived class must override are described.

### `check()`

This function should return a logical scalar.
The task will be prepared and run only if this function returns `TRUE`.


### `prepare()`

This method will be called by `before_script()`.
It is intended to run in the `before_script` phase of the CI run.
You should install all dependent packages here, which then can be cached by the CI system.
You also may include further preparation code here.


### `run()`

This method will be called by `after_success()` or `deploy()`,
depending on your configuration.
It is intended to run in the `after_success` or `deploy` phases of the CI run.
The main difference is that only failed `deploy` tasks will fail the build.
