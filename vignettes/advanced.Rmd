# Running stages conditionally

The conditioned execution of commands is based on environment variables.
The most common use cases are the testing on multiple R versions and the restriction of certain tasks that should only be executed once (e.g. the [deployment of a `pkgdown` site](deployment.html#pkgdown-deployment)).
If you test on multiple CI services you may also want to run certain tasks on only one of them.

Take the execution of `covr::codecov()` as an example.
This call generates a coverage report of how much lines of a R package are covered by unit tests.
It has little benefit to run this on different R versions as the outcome will usually be the same. 
Also it increases the build time on every build without adding value.
It is sufficient to just run it on one R version, e.g. "release".

When you use multiple R versions, Travis/Appveyor automatically set up a build matrix with each build having [set an environment variable for the R version](https://docs.travis-ci.com/user/languages/r/#Environment-Variables) used.
So all you need to do is to condition the stage execution on this env variable:

```r
if ((getRversion() == "release")) {
  get_stage("after_success") %>%
    add_step(covr::codecov())
}
```

A special use case here would be to evaluate the R version inside an argument of `step_rcmdcheck()`.
Here, we set `warnings_are_errors = TRUE` for `getRversion() >= "3.2")`.
Of course this only has an effect if testing on `getRversion() >= "3.2")` is actually specified in `.travis.yml` (see [here](https://github.com/ropenscilabs/tic/blob/36a1b88797e8eb7218cfb767b65490452d47ad8e/.travis.yml#L39-L45) for an example).

```{r}
add_package_checks(warnings_are_errors = (getRversion() >= "3.2"))
```

Note that setting the `after_success` stage explicitly will simply append the commands to what `add_package_checks()` would do in the background for this particular stage.
So steps are not overwritten but incrementally added, even if specified multiple times.

Another condition that comes in handy is to run certain stages only on a specific CI service, e.g. Travis:

```r
if (inherits(ci(), "TravisCI") {
  get_stage("after_success") %>%
    add_step(covr::codecov())
}
```

All this conditioning is specified in `tic.R`, which is a plain R file that is processed internally with `source()`.

# Installing packages

Note that manual installation of Github or CRAN packages should only be used in non-interactive CI runs. 
This can be checked with the condition `ci()$is_interactive()`.

Usually required packages should be installed based on the DESCRIPTION file of a package.
You should only use the following steps in extraordinary circumstances.
One could be the requirement of the _magick_ package for a successful favicon creation for a `pkgdown` website.

## Github packages

Github packages should be installed in the `install` stage:

```r
get_stage("install") %>%
  add_step(step_install_github("r-lib/rcmdcheck"))
```

Note that the underlying `remotes::install_github()` is vectorized for the `repo` argument which means you can pass all packages you want to install in a single function call: `add_step(step_install_github(c("r-lib/rcmdcheck", "r-lib/usethis"))`.

## CRAN packages

Sometimes you need to install CRAN packages that are not specified in the DESCRIPTION file of your package.
For example, to create a favicon in `pkgdown`, the `magick` package is required.
To install the package (only if it does not exist in the cache already), run the following:

```r
get_stage("install") %>%
  add_step(step_install_cran("magick"))
```

# CI Meta-Information

The `ci()` function holds valuable information about the CI system. 
It can be used to query information that can be again be utilized for conditioning stages or steps.

For example, the user may wish to only deploy on Travis by using `inherits(ci(), "TravisCI")`:

```r
if (inherits(ci(), "TravisCI")) {
  get_stage("before_deploy") %>%
    add_step(step_setup_ssh())

  get_stage("deploy") %>%
    add_step(step_push_deploy())
}
```

See `?ci` for more information on which information can be extracted from this function.

# Troubleshooting: Running tic locally

*tic* can be emulated locally in two ways:

## Check for syntax errors

You can run check on possible syntax errors in `tic.R` using `load_from_file()`.
This function will just source `tic.R` to check for possible misspecification errors.
If everything is ok, it will return a list with all stages that are run in the CI build, formatted in the `R6` class style.
Here is a preview of the first two stages:
    
```{r eval = FALSE}
load_from_file()
```

```r
$before_install
<Stage>
  Public:
    add_step: function (step, code) 
    add_task: function (run, check = NULL, prepare = NULL, name = NULL) 
    clone: function (deep = FALSE) 
    initialize: function (name) 
    prepare_all: function () 
    reset: function () 
    run_all: function () 
  Private:
    name: before_install
    prepare_one: function (step) 
    run_one: function (step) 
    steps: list

$install
<Stage>
  Public:
    add_step: function (step, code) 
    add_task: function (run, check = NULL, prepare = NULL, name = NULL) 
    clone: function (deep = FALSE) 
    initialize: function (name) 
    prepare_all: function () 
    reset: function () 
    run_all: function () 
  Private:
    name: install
    prepare_one: function (step) 
    run_one: function (step) 
    steps: list
```

## Emulate a CI run locally

To emulate a real CI run locally, you can call `tic()` and the stages and steps will be executed in your local R console.
Note that doing this will of course use your local system libraries and not the CI environment.

Also some steps will not be executed as they are conditioned to run on non-interactive environments only, e.g. `add_step(covr::codcov())` added by `add_package_checks()`.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
tic::tic()
Running script: step_rcmdcheck(warnings_are_errors = warnings_are_errors, notes_are_errors = notes_are_errors, args = args, build_args = build_args)

# Troubleshooting: Entering the CI build

If your Travis build fails and you have no clue why (error messages are too unspecific, you cannot reproduce the problem locally), you can enter into the Travis build via SSH.
To do so, your repository must be enabled for "ssh debugging".
This means you need to write the Travis CI team an e-mail, asking whether your repo can be [activated for debugging](https://docs.travis-ci.com/user/running-build-in-debug-mode/#enabling-debug-mode).
Usually you get a reply within one day with some additional information on how to enter the build.
However, rather than going the manual way, just take the easy route by calling `travis::travis_debug_job()`.

All it needs is the "Job ID" of the respective build you want to enter.

```{r, echo = FALSE, eval = TRUE, fig.align='center', dpi = 50}
knitr::include_graphics("img/travis-job-id.png")
```

Rather than going to the web interface and getting the "Job ID" there, you can also do it from the command line.
First, you need to query the overall "Build ID" of the run:

```{r eval = FALSE}
travis::travis_get_builds()
```

```
A collection of 25 Travis CI builds:
- id: 416858821, number: 342, state: errored, duration: 3820, event_type: push, ...
- id: 416834229, number: 341, state: errored, duration: 3738, event_type: push, ...
- id: 416135954, number: 340, state: errored, duration: 3338, event_type: push, ...
- id: 416107143, number: 339, state: errored, duration: 3670, event_type: push, ...
- id: 416095854, number: 338, state: passed, duration: 3135, event_type: push, ...
```

Because every "build" has multiple "Jobs", you can now query the "Job ID".
For example, when you know that you want to enter the latest build, you can combine both commands:

```{r eval = FALSE}
build_id <- travis::travis_get_builds()[[1]]$id
travis::travis_get_jobs(build_id)
```

```
A collection of 7 Travis CI jobs:
- id: 416858822, allow_failure: FALSE, number: 342.1, state: passed, started_at: 2018-08-16T15:02:52Z, ...
- id: 416858823, allow_failure: FALSE, number: 342.2, state: passed, started_at: 2018-08-16T15:02:18Z, ...
- id: 416858824, allow_failure: FALSE, number: 342.3, state: passed, started_at: 2018-08-16T15:02:43Z, ...
- id: 416858825, allow_failure: FALSE, number: 342.4, state: passed, started_at: 2018-08-16T15:02:23Z, ...
- id: 416858826, allow_failure: FALSE, number: 342.5, state: passed, started_at: 2018-08-16T15:02:23Z, ...
```

Finally, the build can be entered by calling `travis::travis_debug_job()`:

```{r eval = FALSE}
job_id <- travis::travis_get_jobs(build_id)[[1]]$id
travis::travis_debug_job(job_id)
```

```
Finished restarting debug job 416983664 from Travis CI.
```

Wait a few minutes until the build arrives at the point when it tells you the SSH command you can use to enter the build.
It should look similar to `ssh ukjiuCEkxBBnRAe32Y8xCH0zj@ny2.tmate.io`.
If you still do not want to use the browser manually, simple call `travis::browse()` to open your project on Travis.

Once you are in the build you can use `bash` functions defined by Travis to to execute specific stages:

```sh
travis_run_before_install
travis_run_install
travis_run_before_script
travis_run_script
travis_run_after_success
travis_run_after_failure
travis_run_after_script
```

The debug session is a VM running a [`tmate`](https://tmate.io/) session.
You can use some shortcuts to act in the VM:

- Create multiple windows with `crtl-b c`.  
- Switch to a different window: `crtl-b <window index>` where the indices start with 0, 1, 2 and so on.  
- Scrolling up and down the history: `crtl-b [`. Press `q` to exit the scroll mode.  

Keep in mind that you only have 30 minutes before the VM will be terminated automatically!

# What's not covered yet?

- `SystemRequirements`: *tic* is not yet capable of automatically determining system requirements specified in DESCRIPTION files of an R package. 
Our plan is to automatically provide suggestions like "Please add addons: apt: <library> to `.travis.yml`".
